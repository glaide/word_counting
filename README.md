# Word count documentation

Hello, welcome! This is an application to count the number of words inserted by the user.

This project was wrote in Python and Django, so make sure you have them installed.

So if you don´t have any version of python installed, and no virtual environment, you can check this out: 

[Download Python | Python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

[venv — Creation of virtual environments — Python 3.10.5 documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)

After python and some virtual environment installed, you need to activate your environment, and make sure that you have Django installed **in your virtual environment.** To install Django you can follow this documentation: 

[How to install Django | Django documentation | Django (djangoproject.com)](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/topics/install/)

So now that you have all you need, you can run:

```bash
python --version
python manage.py runserver
```
